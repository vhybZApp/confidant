# Confidant

Confidant is a lightweight automation tool designed to bridge the gap between static software interfaces and the dynamic real world. It enables applications to execute actions autonomously, interacting with UI elements, peripherals, and external devices.

- Automates UI interactions (mouse, keyboard, and more).
- Executes actions based on natural language commands.
- Works across various platforms, from desktop environments to edge devices.
- Designed for minimal resource usage, written in Go.

## Usage  

### Step 1: Configure API Keys

### Step 2: Set Up the Application  

1. Copy the default app environment file:  

   ```sh
   cp default.env .env
   ```  

2. Open `.env` and configure the following:  
   - **LLM_MODEL**: Set this to match the model you configured in `infra/.env`. Example:

     LLM_MODEL=gemini
     ```  

   - **DEVICE_TYPE**: Set this to match your device. Example:  

     ```env
     DEVICE_TYPE="Gnome Linux"
     ```  

     (For macOS, use `"Mac"`, and adjust accordingly for other systems.)  

### Step 3: Start AI Services
