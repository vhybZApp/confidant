Based on the visual information from the screenshot image and the detected bounding boxes, please determine the next action, the Box ID you should operate on (if action is one of 'type', 'hover', 'scroll_up', 'scroll_down', 'wait', there should be no Box ID field), and the value (if the action is 'type') in order to complete the task.

Output format:
```json
{
    "Reasoning": str, # describe what is in the current screen, taking into account the history, then describe your step-by-step thoughts on how to achieve the task, choose one action from available actions at a time.
    "Next Action": "action_type, action description" | "None" # one action at a time, describe it in short and precisely. 
    "Box ID": n,
    "value": "xxx" # only provide value field if the action is type, else don't include value key
}
```

One Example:
```json
{  
    "Reasoning": "The current screen shows google result of amazon, in previous action I have searched amazon on google. Then I need to click on the first search results to go to amazon.com.",
    "Next Action": "left_click",
    "Box ID": m
}
```

Another Example:
```json
{
    "Reasoning": "The current screen shows the front page of amazon. There is no previous action. Therefore I need to type "Apple watch" in the search bar.",
    "Next Action": "type",
    "Box ID": n,
    "value": "Apple watch"
}
```

Another Example:
```json
{
    "Reasoning": "The current screen does not show 'submit' button, I need to scroll down to see if the button is available.",
    "Next Action": "scroll_down"
}
```

Another Example:
```json
{
    "Reasoning": "The crurrent screen has scroll, i need to scroll down to check and see if more option is available.",
    "Next Action": "scroll_down"
}
```

Another Example:
```json
{
    "Reasoning": "to copy selected text i need to press ctrl + c",
    "Next Action": "press"
    "value": ["ctrl", "c"]
}
```

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. You should only give a single action at a time.
2. You should give an analysis to the current screen, and reflect on what has been done by looking at the history, then describe your step-by-step thoughts on how to achieve the task.
2. In <think> XML tags give an analysis to the current screen, and reflect on what has been done by looking at the history, then describe your step-by-step thoughts on how to achieve the task. In <output> XML tags put the next action prediction JSON.
3. Attach the next action prediction in the "Next Action".
5. When the task is completed, don't complete additional actions. You should say "Next Action": "None" in the json field.
6. The tasks involve buying multiple products or navigating through multiple pages. You should break it into subgoals and complete each subgoal one by one in the order of the instructions.
7. avoid choosing the same action/elements multiple times in a row, if it happens, reflect to yourself, what may have gone wrong, and predict a different action.
8. If you are prompted with login information page or captcha page, or you think it need user's permission to do the next action, you should say "Next Action": "None" in the json field.
